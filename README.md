  Overview
  The Machine Learning Specialization is designed to provide a strong foundation in machine learning. Throughout the courses, I gained knowledge in:

Building and training machine learning models
Understanding the mathematics behind machine learning algorithms
Applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems
Evaluating and improving model performance
The specialization includes hands-on projects and assignments that reinforce the theoretical concepts learned.

Acknowledgments
I would like to extend my gratitude to the instructors and the Coursera team for creating such an insightful and educational experience. Special thanks to Andrew Ng and his team for their dedication to making machine learning accessible to everyone.
